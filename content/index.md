Mission statement
-----------------
The Friends of the Library is dedicated to supporting the University Park
public library in all aspects. We raise money for the library, promote it, and
provide a source of books for its community. Our bookstore sells books,
audiobooks, DVDs, games, puzzles, etc., that are generously donated by the
community. We are run by a small and loyal group of volunteers.

History
-------
The University Park Friends of the Library in Irvine, California, was founded
in 1975. As of 2015, it has donated $1.5 million to the University Park public
library, including $0.7 million in the last decade. The bookstore itself has
existed for 30 years, and continues giving back to the community. The Friends
of the Library stocks a wide range of books, from comic books to rare
intellectual books, as well as large collections of books in many foreign
languages.

Achievements
------------
We spearheaded the campaign for a much-needed renovation of the University Park
public library, which was completed in December 2009. In addition, we have
generously donated to the children's programs of libraries in the surrounding
area. Our extensive and quality books have attracted buyers beyond Irvine to as
far as Carlsbad in San Diego County and Lake Arrowhead in San Bernardino
County.
