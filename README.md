# Irvine University Park Friends of the Library

## About

### Mission statement

The Friends of the Library is dedicated to supporting the University Park public library in all aspects. We raise money for the library, promote it, and provide a source of books for its community. Our bookstore sells books, audiobooks, DVDs, games, puzzles, etc., that are generously donated by the community. We are run by a small and loyal group of volunteers.

### History

The University Park Friends of the Library in Irvine, California, was founded in 1975. As of 2015, it has donated $1.5 million to the University Park public library, including $0.7 million in the last decade. The bookstore itself has existed for 30 years, and continues giving back to the community. The Friends of the Library stocks a wide range of books, from comic books to rare intellectual books, as well as large collections of books in many foreign languages.

### Achievements

We spearheaded the campaign for a much-needed renovation of the University Park public library, which was completed in December 2009. In addition, we have generously donated to the children’s programs of libraries in the surrounding area. Our extensive and quality books have attracted buyers beyond Irvine to as far as Carlsbad in San Diego County and Lake Arrowhead in San Bernardino County.

### Memorial leaf donation

Donations of $500 in memory of deceased loved ones and friends will be displayed as a _GOLD LEAF_ on our Friends of the Library Memory Garden Tree. Donations of $1,000 and more for a living contributor will be displayed as a _GOLD LEAF_ on our Friends of the Library Memory Garden Tree.
